# Global Air Pollution Data Analysis

This project explores global air pollution patterns using data visualization and geospatial mapping in R.  
It examines how the Air Quality Index (AQI) varies across countries and regions and identifies major pollution hotspots worldwide.

## Project Overview
- **Objective:** To analyze and visualize global AQI trends using R.
- **Dataset:** Global Air Pollution Dataset (cleaned version)
- **Key Tools:** R, RStudio, R Markdown, ggplot2, dplyr, sf, rnaturalearth
- **Output:** Interactive HTML report with visualizations and global AQI map.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning and preprocessing in R
- Statistical analysis using tidyverse
- Advanced visualization using ggplot2
- Geospatial mapping with sf and rnaturalearth
- Report generation via R Markdown

## Key Insights
- Asia and the Middle East have the highest AQI averages.
- PM2.5 levels are the strongest contributor to overall AQI and have a strong correlation with AQI levels.
- Developed regions like Oceania and Europe maintain cleaner air.
- The developing region of South America has cleaner air than the developed region of North America.
- Most of the cities have a good or moderate air quality.
